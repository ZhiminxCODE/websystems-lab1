When I started this project, I quickly realized that it had been a long time since I last worked with HTML and CSS. I remembered the basics — like div tags, linking stylesheets, and simple formatting — but it had been so long that I felt rusty. Because of this, I constantly had to look up references and tutorials to refresh my memory.

For the HTML/CSS layout, I revisited MDN Web Docs and some YouTube tutorials to remind myself of the difference between Flexbox and Grid. I ended up using Grid for the overall structure and Flexbox inside certain components. That solved the layout issue.

For the microformats, I had to read the Microformats Wiki and compare example code with mine. Eventually, I learned that these classes don’t change the look of the page — they just add meaning to the markup. Once I stopped expecting them to “style” things, it made more sense.

For the GitHub push issue, I learned that I only committed README.md. I fixed it by running git add . to stage all files, committing again, and pushing. That’s when everything showed up on GitHub.
